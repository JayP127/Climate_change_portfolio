        "# Introduction\n",
        "This Google Colab notebook presents an innovative approach to evaluating the availability and accessibility of carbon footprint information for various products, a pressing need in our increasingly environmentally-conscious society. This investigation contributes to sustainability and transparency, empowering consumers and companies with vital knowledge to make informed decisions that minimize environmental impact.\n",
        "\n",
        "The foundation of this notebook is Python, a versatile and widely-accepted language known for its simplicity and robustness. Leveraging the capabilities of Python, we've harnessed the power of the Langchain library, a tool that has been instrumental in handling language processing tasks. This has enabled us to engage with data in a meaningful and insightful manner, drawing accurate and valuable conclusions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Our approach uses an Agent that employs three distinct tools for information retrieval.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Pinecone Vectorstore:** This tool stores and manages vector embeddings of data that represent the carbon footprint of different products. The embeddings are derived from several comprehensive datasets, including GWP100 Global warming potential average of CML v4.8 2006, EDIP 2003, IPCC2021, and ReCiPe 2016 v1.3. Pinecone's efficient similarity search capabilities help us find the most relevant information expediently.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Google Search Tool:** A vital and expansive source of information, the Google Search Tool serves as our gateway to the vast information available on the internet. This allows our Agent to broaden its search and cover more ground.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Calculator:** Last but not least, our Agent incorporates a calculator tool to perform necessary computations and produce accurate estimates when needed.\n",
        "\n",
        "Our Agent is designed to deliver the best possible answer to queries about product carbon footprints, striving to cite sources wherever possible. The amalgamation of these techniques provides a rich, comprehensive picture of the carbon footprint information landscape.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this notebook, we take you through the entire process: from how we've integrated these different tools to form a robust, effective Agent to how we've leveraged this Agent to uncover and evaluate the carbon footprint data. Join us as we delve into the fascinating world of data, sustainability, and the power of informed decisions.\n"
