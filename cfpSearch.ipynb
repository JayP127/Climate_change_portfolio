        "# Introduction\n",
        "This Google Colab notebook presents an LLM approach to the accessibility of carbon footprint information of products and services, a pressing need in our increasingly environmentally-conscious society. This investigation contributes to sustainability and transparency, empowering consumers and companies with vital knowledge to make informed decisions that minimize environmental impact.\n",
        "\n",
        "The programming language of this notebook is Python, a versatile and widely-accepted language known for its simplicity and robustness. Leveraging the capabilities of Python, we've harnessed the power of the Langchain library, a tool that has been instrumental in handling language processing tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "Our approach uses an Agent that employs three different tools for information retrieval.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Pinecone vector store:** This tool stores and manages vector embeddings of data that represents the carbon footprint of products and services. The embeddings are derived from several comprehensive datasets, including GWP100 Global warming potential average of CML v4.8 2006, EDIP 2003, IPCC2021, ReCiPe 2016 v1.3, and a carbon catalog of 866 products from an article published in Nature. The dataset consists of 22,105 vectors (products), each with 1536 dimensions. Pinecone's efficient similarity search capabilities help us expediently find the most relevant information. When the model cites pinecone as the source of information, it refers to the dataset contained in this Pinecone Vectorstore.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Google Search Tool:** A vital and expansive source of information, the Google Search Tool serves as our gateway to the vast information available on the internet. The Search tool allows our Agent to broaden its search and cover more ground.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Calculator:** Our Agent incorporates a calculator tool to perform necessary computations and produce estimates when needed.\n",
        "\n",
        "Our Agent is designed to deliver the best possible answer to queries about product carbon footprints, striving to cite sources wherever possible. The amalgamation of these techniques provides a picture of the carbon footprint information landscape.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this notebook, we take you through the entire process: from how we've integrated these different tools to form an effective agent to how we've leveraged this Agent to uncover and evaluate the carbon footprint data.\n",
        "\n",
        "LLM applications always have room for improvement as sometimes will lead to hallucinations or answers that are not real. However, it is clear to us that research in the field of LLMs is moving fast; with the advent of more capable LLMs, larger and more accurate datasets, better tools, and prompt writing, these improvements will be significant in the near future.\n",
        "\n",
        "To work with the model below, you need to obtain four API keys from the following websites:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
